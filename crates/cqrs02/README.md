# CQRS01

Highly experimental 'dry-run' implementation of a [ROM example](https://github.com/davydovanton/cqrs-ruby-example).

Alternative to add:

- [rom-and-dry-showcase-part-1](https://ryanbigg.com/2020/02/rom-and-dry-showcase-part-1)
- [setup-ruby-object-mapper](https://medium.com/@igkuz/how-to-setup-ruby-object-mapper-rom-for-standalone-project-15472fcf31e1)

What parts of CQRS might RTM be suited to.

## FAQ

> Why did you create this repository?

As a fun experiment.  To learn.

> Why did you choose <technology_name>?

Because I know it, I stumbled upon it or I wanted to experiment with it.

## Important

This is not yet even code that compiles.
The goal of this repository is to explore how one might implement the CQRS pattern
in Rust using RTM. You should use other crates for the foreseeable future.
